# Group Relative Policy Optimization for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: A Deep Dive into GRPO-CoT

## Introduction: 

Will walk you through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and how I have implemented it for Chain-of-Thought reasoning. GRPO got introduced by DeepSeek, and as you may have seen, DeepSeek introduced a really powerful reasoning model with very few parameters. So this method is what made it work so well.

Let me start with a problem we'll use throughout this paper:
**Solve for x in the equation 2x + 4 = 10**

Now, I'm going to give you some solutions that our AI model might produce, and you help me think which one is the best:

1. **Solution 1**: x = 6
2. **Solution 2**: x = 3  
3. **Solution 3**: Subtract 4 from both sides to get 2x = 6, then divide both sides by 2. So you get x = 3.

How would you rank these three solutions from best to worst? Well, clearly solution one is the worst because it's plain wrong. Between two and three though, I would say that two is the so-so one because it only shows the answer, whereas solution three shows its work and it's fully correct. Every step is perfect. So this one's the one that wins.

And what we're going to do is train a model to produce solutions like the third one.

## Self-Supervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning

Now, how do we train a model to give an answer by showing intermediate steps? We have two main ways to do it: Self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (or GRPO).

### Self-Supervised Learning: The Expensive Way

Basically, we want to solve a math problem. How do you do it using supervised learning? Well, you produce a lot of data for the model to learn. And the data - you produce it by hiring a lot of really smart people. So you hire a lot of mathematicians or people who can solve these math problems, and they produce a lot of solutions. We tell these people: "Hey, write the solutions using carefully written steps." And then we feed those to the model, and the model learns to write solutions the way they were given to it. It's basically supervised learning.

### Reinforcement Learning: The Game Approach

Now, how do we do this with reinforcement learning? We make the computer play a game, basically against itself. What we do is we use the model to create a solution and we tell it to write the solution using a bunch of steps. These steps could be completely wrong, but it doesn't matter - its solution comes out with steps. And then we use the same model or other methods to actually check if the steps are okay one by one and if the solution is okay.

Now there's a strength that these models have: They're not so great at creating, but they're really good at understanding previous stuff. So actually a large language model can be really good just by itself at grading problems. It may not know how to produce solutions so well, but it can grade them well. And that, used in combination with other methods (say software that can check the math or several heuristics), then we have a really strong grader.

And since this grader is really strong, then it feeds information back into the original model. And the original model is able to create better and better and better solutions.

### Why Reinforcement Learning Wins

Why is this method better than supervised learning? Well, for instance, supervised learning is really expensive. It's really expensive to get a lot of people to produce a lot of solutions. And also it's limited - the model can only be as good as the top person who creates these solutions. 

Whereas reinforcement learning has no limit. It can really come up with reasoning methods that maybe humans haven't even come up with yet. It's analogous to how we get computers to play games like chess and Go. We can record a lot of games and give them the games in a supervised learning way, or we can make the computer play against itself. And it's shown that letting the computer play against itself can produce a much, much better model. And actually, that's how models were able to beat the best human at chess and at Go.

## The GRPO Loss Function: Breaking Down the "Big Ugly Formula"

Okay, so that was the overview, but now let me get into the details of GRPO. Let's look at the loss function:

```
L = E_π[Σ_t min(π_θ(a_t|s_t)/π_θ_old(a_t|s_t) × Â_t, clip(π_θ(a_t|s_t)/π_θ_old(a_t|s_t), 1-ε, 1+ε) × Â_t)] - β*D_KL[π_θ||π_θ_old]
```

Now this looks very ugly, but I promise we're going to go over every single detail of this formula and you're going to notice that it's actually pretty simple. So when you see formulas like this, don't get scared. It's a cryptic way to convey some really nice ideas.

### Part 1: Average Over All Responses (E_π)

Let's go for the easy part. That first expectation E_π - well, that's just the average over all the responses the computer gives you. The computer gives you a thousand responses? Then you just add all the scores and divide by 1,000.

### Part 2: Average Over All Steps (Σ_t)

What does the summation do? Well, let's say that you have an answer with 10 steps. The last one is the answer. So we simply score each step, including the answer, and then divide by 10, which is the number of steps in this case. That's the aggregation part.

### Part 3: The Probability Ratio (π_θ/π_θ_old)

This over here is the probability of a new response divided by the probability of an old response. Let me explain this in detail.

Let's say we have our problem: Solve x in the equation 2x + 4 = 10. The model outputs solutions with probabilities. For example, when the model said the answer is x = 2, what happens is that it provided a bunch of probabilities for possible answers. Let's say for simplicity that the possible answers are 2, 3, and 4 for x.

**Before Training (Old Policy):**
- P(x=2) = 0.6 (wrong answer, high probability - bad!)
- P(x=3) = 0.3 (correct answer, low probability)  
- P(x=4) = 0.1

**After Training (New Policy):**
- P(x=2) = 0.2 (wrong answer, reduced - good!)
- P(x=3) = 0.7 (correct answer, increased - great!)
- P(x=4) = 0.1 (wrong answer, stayed same)

Now we calculate the policy ratio for each:
- For x=2: 0.2/0.6 = 0.333 (we want this small - reducing bad answers)
- For x=3: 0.7/0.3 = 2.333 (we want this big - increasing good answers)
- For x=4: 0.1/0.1 = 1.0 (no change)

### Part 4: The Advantage Score (Â_t)

This Â over here is a score for the quality of each step of the response. Notice that the A has a hat, and the hat is because we normalize the scores.

Let's go back to our problem and score each solution:

**Solution 1** (all wrong):
- Step 1: 2x + 4 = 10, multiply by 2 → Score: -0.1 (wrong step)
- Step 2: 4x + 8 = 20, so x = 4 → Score: -0.1 (wrong step)
- Answer: x = 4 → Score: -1.0 (wrong answer)

**Solution 2** (correct answer, poor reasoning):
- Step 1: 2x + 4 = 10, multiply by 2 → Score: -0.1 (wrong step)
- Step 2: x = 3 → Score: +0.2 (correct but no justification)
- Answer: x = 3 → Score: +1.0 (correct answer)

**Solution 3** (perfect):
- Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides → Score: +0.2 (correct step)
- Step 2: 2x = 6, divide by 2 → Score: +0.2 (correct step)
- Answer: x = 3 → Score: +1.0 (correct answer)

Now we normalize these scores. Let's say all these scores have:
- Average = 0.111
- Standard deviation = 0.578

We normalize by: (score - average) / standard_deviation

This gives us Â_t values centered at 0 with standard deviation 1. This normalization is crucial - it keeps our training stable.

### Part 5: Multiplying Ratio × Advantage

Now here's where the magic happens. We multiply the policy ratio by the advantage:

- For x=2: ratio(0.333) × advantage(-1.5) = -0.5 (negative - reduce this!)
- For x=3: ratio(2.333) × advantage(+1.5) = +3.5 (positive - increase this!)
- For x=4: ratio(1.0) × advantage(-1.5) = -1.5 (negative - reduce this!)

The model learns: "Increase probabilities where this product is positive, decrease where negative."

### Part 6: The Clipping Function

We don't want numbers in this formula to be too big or too small. If we have a thousand there, it messes everything up. So we want things to give information but not be too big or too small.

Here's the problem: Let's say we have two policies with these probabilities:
- Old: [0.999, 0.001]
- New: [0.9, 0.1]

The ratios are:
- First: 0.9/0.999 ≈ 0.901 (manageable)
- Second: 0.1/0.001 = 100 (too big!)

100 is a big number to put in a loss function. It can mess up your model. So we clip it.

The clip function says: if your ratio is bigger than 1+ε, make it 1+ε. If it's smaller than 1-ε, make it 1-ε. Otherwise, leave it as is.

With ε = 0.2:
- Maximum ratio: 1.2
- Minimum ratio: 0.8
- Our 100 becomes 1.2

### Part 7: The KL Divergence Term

Finally, this β*D_KL term makes sure that the model doesn't deviate too much from the previous one. You want to make these changes small and gradual. The moment you start making big changes in the model, things get risky because you may fix one solution but mess up all the other ones.

Let me show you with an example. Original policy gives these probabilities for x = 1, 2, 3, 4:
- Original: [0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.4]

After training, we have two candidates:

**Candidate 1** (small changes):
- New: [0.05, 0.05, 0.5, 0.4]
- Changed x=3 from 0.4 to 0.5 ✓

**Candidate 2** (wild changes):  
- New: [0.35, 0.05, 0.55, 0.05]
- Changed everything drastically ✗

Even though Candidate 2 increased x=3 more (0.4→0.55), we prefer Candidate 1 because it made smaller changes. It's like editing an essay - you want to fix the mistakes without rewriting everything and potentially introducing new errors.

The KL divergence measures how different the distributions are, and we multiply by β (typically 0.01) to control how much we penalize changes.

## Our Implementation: GRPO-CoT

Now let's see how we implement this for Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

### Stage 1: SFT (Teaching the Format)

First, we teach the model the basic format of step-by-step solutions:

```python
def create_sft_example(problem, solution, answer):
    # We create diverse templates
    templates = [
        "Let me solve this step by step.",
        "I'll work through this problem systematically.",
        "Let me break this down step by step."
    ]
    
    return {
        "prompt": f"Problem: {problem}\n\nSolution: {random.choice(templates)}\n",
        "completion": f"{solution}\n\nTherefore, the answer is {answer}."
    }
```

### Stage 2: GRPO (Perfecting the Reasoning)

Now comes the GRPO training. For each problem:

```python
# Generate K=4 responses with different temperatures
responses = []
for k in range(4):
    temperature = 0.6 + (k * 0.1)  # 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
    response = model.generate(prompt, temperature=temperature)
    responses.append(response)

# Score each response
rewards = []
for response in responses:
    # Base reward from answer correctness
    answer_reward = check_answer(response)
    
    # CoT quality reward
    cot_features = extract_cot_features(response)
    cot_reward = (
        0.3 * cot_features['has_steps'] +
        0.2 * cot_features['has_calculations'] +
        0.2 * cot_features['has_reasoning_words'] +
        0.1 * cot_features['has_conclusion'] +
        0.2 * cot_features['step_coherence']
    )
    
    total_reward = 0.7 * answer_reward + 0.3 * cot_reward
    rewards.append(total_reward)

# Compute baseline (average reward)
baseline = sum(rewards) / len(rewards)

# Update model using GRPO
for response, reward in zip(responses, rewards):
    advantage = reward - baseline
    
    # Get probabilities
    old_probs = reference_model.get_probs(response)
    new_probs = policy_model.get_probs(response)
    
    # Compute ratio
    ratio = new_probs / old_probs
    
    # Clip ratio
    clipped_ratio = torch.clip(ratio, 1-epsilon, 1+epsilon)
    
    # GRPO loss
    loss = -min(ratio * advantage, clipped_ratio * advantage)
    
    # Add KL penalty
    kl_div = kl_divergence(new_probs, old_probs)
    loss += beta * kl_div
    
    # Update
    optimizer.step(loss)
```

### The CoT-Aware Reward Model

Our reward model specifically values Chain-of-Thought features:

```python
class CoTAwareRewardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/deberta-v3-base")
        
        # Two heads: one for answer quality, one for reasoning quality
        self.answer_head = nn.Linear(768, 1)
        self.reasoning_head = nn.Linear(768, 1)
        
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.base_model(input_ids, attention_mask)
        pooled = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0]  # [CLS] token
        
        answer_score = self.answer_head(pooled)
        reasoning_score = self.reasoning_head(pooled)
        
        # Combine with weights
        total_score = 0.7 * answer_score + 0.3 * reasoning_score
        
        # Bound between -3 and 3 using tanh
        return 3.0 * torch.tanh(total_score / 3.0)
```

## Results: What GRPO-CoT Achieves

Let me show you how the model improves through GRPO training:

### Iteration 0 (Before GRPO)
```
Problem: A baker made 156 cookies. He sold 89. How many are left?
Solution: 156 - 89 = 67
```
Simple, correct, but no reasoning shown.

### Iteration 10
```
Problem: A baker made 156 cookies. He sold 89. How many are left?
Solution: I need to subtract the sold cookies from total.
156 - 89 = 67
```
Starting to show some reasoning.

### Iteration 50 (After GRPO)
```
Problem: A baker made 156 cookies. He sold 89. How many are left?
Solution: Let me solve this step by step.

Step 1: The baker started with 156 cookies.
Step 2: He sold 89 cookies.
Step 3: To find how many are left, I need to subtract: 156 - 89
Step 4: 156 - 89 = 67

Therefore, the baker has 67 cookies left.
```
Beautiful! Clear steps, explanations, and correct answer.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory-Efficient GRPO for Large Models

When working with 8B parameter models, memory becomes crucial:

```python
def memory_efficient_grpo(batch, model, ref_model, K=2):
    total_loss = 0
    
    for i, prompt in enumerate(batch):
        # Generate and process one response at a time
        for k in range(K):
            # Generate
            response = model.generate(prompt, temperature=0.6+k*0.1)
            
            # Score
            reward = score_response(response)
            
            # Compute gradients immediately
            loss = compute_grpo_loss(response, reward, model, ref_model)
            loss.backward()
            
            # Free memory
            del response, reward, loss
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        
        # Update after K responses
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Distributed Training with DeepSpeed

For multi-GPU training, we use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3:

```python
ds_config = {
    "train_batch_size": batch_size * K * world_size,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": K,
    "zero_optimization": {
        "stage": 3,
        "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu", "pin_memory": True},
        "offload_param": {"device": "cpu", "pin_memory": True},
        "overlap_comm": True,
        "contiguous_gradients": True,
        "reduce_bucket_size": 1e8,
        "stage3_prefetch_bucket_size": 1e7,
        "stage3_gather_16bit_weights_on_model_save": True
    },
    "bf16": {"enabled": True}  # Better than fp16 for large models
}
```

## Key Insights and Lessons

### 1. Why K=4 Works Best
- K<4: Not enough diversity to compute good baselines
- K>4: Diminishing returns, too much compute
- K=4: Sweet spot for diversity vs efficiency

### 2. The Importance of Normalization
Normalizing advantages (Â) is crucial. Without it:
- Some steps get huge gradients
- Training becomes unstable
- Model can catastrophically forget

### 3. Clipping Saves Training
Without clipping, a single bad probability ratio can destroy your model:
- Old prob: 0.001, New prob: 0.5 → Ratio: 500!
- This creates massive gradients
- Clipping keeps ratios in [0.8, 1.2] for stability

### 4. KL Penalty Prevents Overfitting
The KL term acts like a regularizer:
- Too small β: Model changes too fast, forgets other tasks
- Too large β: Model doesn't learn
- β=0.01 works well for most cases

## Conclusion

GRPO is a powerful method that combines the best of reinforcement learning with the stability of supervised learning. By carefully balancing exploration (trying new solutions) with exploitation (reinforcing good patterns), we can train models that not only solve problems but explain their reasoning clearly.

The key insight is this: don't just reward correct answers - reward the entire thinking process. When you combine this with technical innovations like advantage normalization, ratio clipping, and KL regularization, you get a training method that can push models beyond human-level reasoning ability while maintaining transparency.
